<p>I chose the riddle of the sphinx. Originally I was going to go with a longer story than what was required, but that was because I didn't read the flow chart right. I really wanted to do something clever that allowed for good writing. I hope I at least got the clever part right.</p>
<p>I had trouble with the limitations of the variable. With how I designed the story it didn't seem to easily fit with the conditions that existed there. The biggest problem I had was a bool answer because I didn't write the Sphinx to ask a yes or no riddle. Instead I used an int value to select between the correct answers.</p>
